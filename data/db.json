      "content": "\nIn the past, when I got a call from mom or dad, this is how I would react. Hi. But now, Hi.\n\nIn the past, all the calls were the same. Same script. Did you eat? Yes, I ate. How are you? I'm good, you? Yes, yes. Okay, that's it. We were connected by biology, an obligation to love each other, but no depth or meaning.\n\nI think I figured out the problem. The problem is, we still see them as parents, and they see us as children. Let me explain.\n\nYou see, in childhood, we don't see our parents as parents. We think of them as superheroes. They can fix any problem we have.\n\nIf you're hungry, they give you food. If you cry, they soothe you. If you want to sleep, they put you to sleep. Any problem you had, they fixed it. So we don't see them as a human being. Human beings who have flaws, who make mistakes, who carry their own set of pain.\n\nOn the other side, they still see us as kids. They see us as kids who can't protect ourselves. You know, four years ago, I quit my very high-paying job. When I told my dad, he was absolutely against it. We fought a lot. And it really bothered me, until I understood this.\n\nI was still seeing him as a parent, who has to understand and fix my problem. And he was still seeing me as a kid, who cannot protect herself. But the truth is, we were just human beings, with fears and flaws. Trying to look out for each other. Care for each other.\n\nSo I realised, the first step in healing my relationship with my parents. I shouldn't see them as parents. I have to see them as humans, who've made mistakes. Show them compassion. Accept those mistakes. And hopefully, hope that they see me not just as a 15-year-old kid, who can't ride the scooter. But as an adult woman, who can take care of herself.\n\nAnd maybe that's the step you should take, to repair the relationship with your parents. Hope this helped.\n\n",
